User: tell me the capital of spain
Rusty: Madrid


User: tell me the population
Rusty: The population of Madrid is a bit tricky to give a precise number for, as it depends on what area you're considering.

* **Madrid City (Municipio de Madrid):**  This refers to the administrative city limits.  The population is roughly 3.3 million.

* **Madrid Metropolitan Area (√Årea Metropolitana de Madrid):** This includes the surrounding suburbs and towns.  The population is significantly larger, estimated to be around 6.7 million.

So, depending on the definition, the population is either around **3.3 million** or around **6.7 million**.
